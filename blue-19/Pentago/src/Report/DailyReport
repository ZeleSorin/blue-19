    /** GAME IMPLEMENTATION **\

We have chosen to implement the Pentago game using the same method that was provided to us in the week 5 TicTacToe game
due to the existing code and resources . We have implemented the game as a length 36 array holding all the posible moves
on the board. We adapted the toString method of the Board class to accommodate the new time of board consisting of 4
quadrants each having the possibility to rotate counter clockwise or clockwise.
The major changes were on the hasDiagonal method were we did a little bit of hard-coding in checking the possible
winning diagonals.
As per AI strategies, there will be two , one Naive and one Smart strategy which can be selected as opponents at the
beginning of any game .

Up to this point we had really insignificant bugs, some minor IndexOutOfBounds exceptions due to the wrong implementation
of the hasDiagonal and rotateBoard. Sorin tried to implement the rotateBoard method using matrices and rotating those,
but Bram had a better and faster idea, at the end Bram's idea was implemented.
